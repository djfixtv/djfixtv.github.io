                <p>Persona 5 Royal is a JRPG set in modern-day Tokyo, released in 2019 as an extension to the original 2016 game. The story follows a high school student, Ren Amamiya (known commonly through his codename/alias Joker), who was put on probation after being falsely accused of assault, transferring to a new school. Over the course of the game, taking place through the school year, Joker and other students he befriends awaken to special powers born out of rebellion, summoning powerful entities known as Personas. With this desire to break free from the chains of the world they live in, a shared goal of revolution and changing society is formed in their collective, the vigilante group by the name of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. Through exploring a supernatural realm formed through the collective of humanity's subconcious desires - known as the Metaverse - the group fights battles against enemies (known as Shadows), with the ultimate aim to change the hearts of the morally distorted.</p>
